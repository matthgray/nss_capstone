# NSS CAPSTON
## My capstone project for the Nashville Software School data science cohort of 2021

### Purpose:
Will schools become a bigger force for where people locate? Will that be a problem for cities? My analysis and application provide teachers, policy maker, and parents the ability to study schools across the state of Tennessee based on achievement scores, teacher retention, and chronically absent students. Also, the application will visualize which counties are spending the most money(locally) on per pupil expenditure.

### Executive Summary:
Explore data from Nashville Schools from 2019 and 2020.This will include achievement scores, spending by county, and percent of teachers retained. The 2020 analysis will include high school data for graduate rate, dropout rate, etc. I will create a streamlit application for users to explore the data on their own. This would allow them to filter on the type of school, school name, and provide key statistics for that school. I have made two machine learning model applications. One for classification and one for regression.
